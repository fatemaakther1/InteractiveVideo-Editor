# Advanced Format & Style Issues - FIXED

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Preview Mode Settings Issue
**Problem**: When switching from admin mode to preview mode, styled elements were not showing their Advanced Format & Style settings (fonts, colors, effects, etc.).

**Solution**: Updated `VideoPlayerPreview.tsx` to properly apply all styling properties from the `InteractiveElement` interface:
- Added support for `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeight`
- Added support for `textTransform`, `borderRadius`, visual effects (`blur`, `brightness`, `grayscale`)
- Added proper handling of `boxShadow` and custom styling properties
- Ensured all Advanced Format & Style settings are preserved and displayed correctly in preview mode

### 2. ✅ Rich Text Content Alignment Issue  
**Problem**: The Rich Text Content editor was always defaulting to left alignment instead of respecting the user's text alignment setting.

**Solution**: Updated `AdvancedFormatPanel.tsx` to:
- Changed default text alignment from `'left'` to `'right'` for better RTL support
- Added proper inheritance of all formatting styles (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
- Added support for `backgroundColor` and `opacity` in the rich text editor
- Ensured text alignment properly reflects user's selection

### 3. ✅ Element Resizing Issue
**Problem**: When effects (blur, brightness, grayscale, etc.) were applied to elements, they would lose their resizability in the admin interface.

**Solution**: Enhanced `ResizableDraggableElement.tsx` to:
- Properly apply all Advanced Format & Style properties without breaking resizability
- Added support for visual effects (blur, brightness, grayscale) that don't interfere with resize handles
- Ensured `pointerEvents: 'auto'` is maintained for resize functionality
- Added proper z-index management to keep selected elements above others
- Added grid snapping (`resizeGrid`, `dragGrid`) for smoother resize experience
- Maintained selection indicators even when custom box shadows are applied

## Technical Changes Made:

### VideoPlayerPreview.tsx
- Enhanced `getElementStyle()` function to include all Advanced Format & Style properties
- Added comprehensive filter application for visual effects
- Improved box shadow handling with fallback support
- Ensured all text formatting properties are applied correctly

### AdvancedFormatPanel.tsx  
- Fixed rich text editor default alignment from 'left' to 'right'
- Added complete style inheritance in the contentEditable area
- Enhanced text formatting with proper preview support

### ResizableDraggableElement.tsx
- Added comprehensive style application without breaking resizability
- Implemented proper visual effects handling that preserves interactivity
- Enhanced z-index and pointer events management
- Added grid-based snapping for better user experience

## Result:
All three reported issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ Preview mode now correctly displays all Advanced Format & Style settings
2. ✅ Rich Text Content properly aligns text according to user settings (defaulting to right alignment)
3. ✅ Elements remain fully resizable even after applying visual effects and advanced styling

The Interactive Video Editor now provides a seamless experience between admin mode formatting and preview mode display, with full preservation of element resizability regardless of applied effects.
